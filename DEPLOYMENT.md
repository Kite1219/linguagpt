# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your translation app with Oxford Dictionary integration to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code should be in a GitHub repository
2. **Netlify Account** - Sign up at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. **OpenAI API Key** - Get one from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Code to GitHub

Make sure all your code is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment with Oxford Dictionary"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Connect to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Select your translator repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add the following variable:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-...`)

### 4. Deploy

1. Click **Deploy site**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Your site will be available at a URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### 5. Test the Oxford Dictionary Feature

Once deployed:

1. Go to your live site
2. Translate any English word (e.g., "hello", "work", "beautiful")
3. Click the **"Show More"** button
4. You should see real Oxford Dictionary data with:
   - Definitions and multiple senses
   - Pronunciation (IPA)
   - Example sentences
   - Part of speech information
   - Direct links to Oxford Dictionary

## Features After Deployment

✅ **Real Oxford Dictionary Data** - No more mock data  
✅ **Any English Word** - Works with the entire Oxford Dictionary  
✅ **Smart Fallbacks** - Tries multiple lookup strategies  
✅ **Proper Error Handling** - Graceful failures  
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Respectful to Oxford's servers  

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify there are no TypeScript errors

### Oxford Dictionary Not Working
- Check Netlify function logs in dashboard
- Verify the function deployed correctly
- Some words might not be available in Oxford Dictionary

### Translation Not Working
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Look at function logs for specific errors

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. Follow the DNS configuration steps

## Performance Optimization

The app includes:
- **Caching** for dictionary lookups
- **Lazy loading** for modals
- **Optimized builds** with Create React App
- **CDN delivery** through Netlify

## Security

- Environment variables are secure and not exposed to client
